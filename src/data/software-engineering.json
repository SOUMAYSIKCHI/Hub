It provides a structured roadmap for development, ensuring quality and efficient delivery. While various models exist, the general phases are: **1. Requirements Gathering**: Understanding stakeholder needs. **2. Design**: Architecting the solution. **3. Implementation/Coding**: Writing the software. **4. Testing**: Verifying functionality and quality. **5. Deployment**: Releasing the software. **6. Maintenance**: Post-deployment support and enhancements.",

Next, you actually build it brick by brick (Coding). After that, you check if all the parts fit and if it stands strong (Testing). Then, you put it on display (Deployment). Finally, you might fix any broken pieces or add new rooms later (Maintenance).",

          "explanation": "**Software Design Principles** are guidelines that help in designing robust, maintainable, extensible, and scalable software systems. They are not rigid rules but rather recommendations for structuring code. A prominent set of principles is **SOLID**: **S**ingle Responsibility, **O**pen/Closed, **L**iskov Substitution, **I**nterface Segregation, and **D**ependency Inversion. Adhering to these principles leads to cleaner and more adaptable codebases.",

Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.",
